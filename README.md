# blockchaintabs is a magazine dapp which allows for sharing of knowledge about the blockchain and web3 world between blockchain ethusiasts.
The magazine website will be a great resource destination for blockchain enthusiasts who want to learn more about the different blockchains. And it would also provide platform for other blockchain professionals who want to publish their work for it to be visible to the online community to be able to do so easily. 
#when you create a post, the ipfs hash of your post is saved to the blockchain so that you can always retrive your post from ipfs using its hash. this gives you full ownership and rights to your post.
#Underlying technology include
1. REACT : used to create the front and and build the app
2. Solidity: for creation of smart contract
3. web3.js : to connect the app to the blockchain
4. ipfs : to store files and contents
5. Truffle : for compiling ,testing and deploying of smart contract.

To run,clone my repo and install dependencies using npm install.
you also need to have some goerli coins because the smart contract was deployed in goerli testnet.
